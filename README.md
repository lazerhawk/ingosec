*An exploration of infosec-y tools using Golang*

The tools here I am making as I follow along with Justin Seitz's pretty great book, [Black Hat Python](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython)
Having skimmed through the book before in its written language, I decided re-reading the book and working through the tools using Golang would be an interesting main effort for my [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

## Tools made
- [tcproxy](https://github.com/ryantenorio/tcproxy) - A WIP TCP Proxy
- gnc - A netcat clone in Golang. It's currently in this repo and if I finish it I'll move it to its own package.
