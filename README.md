*An exploration of infosec-y tools using Golang*

The tools here I am making as I follow along with Justin Seitz's pretty great book, [Black Hat Python](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython)
Having skimmed through the book before in its written language, I decided re-reading the book and working through the tools using Golang would be an interesting main effort for my [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).
